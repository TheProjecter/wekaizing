Installation instructions:

-If not avaiable, create a folder called libraries under your sketch folder in Processing.
-In the libraries folder, put the wekaizing folder in.
-Go to your weka installation, find weka.jar and copy it to:
	libraries/wekaizing/library/weka.jar
-Make sure you have the right weka (Mac/Windows/Linux are different and won't work if wrong)
-Now the library should be available to import in Processing, if not, all you need to say is import wekaizing.*; at the beginning.
